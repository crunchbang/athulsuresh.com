Our telephone server infrastructure and the associated cloud services were spread across two AWS regions - Singapore \u0026 Mumbai. This was primarily done to comply with Indian Data Protection Laws which mandated that customer data associated with some critical areas of business must stay within the country. We had run these two regions as independent entities, with code changes being deployed uniformly across them.\nOwing to some changes we had done as part of another unification project, we managed to make the physical servers agnostic of the AWS region. It allowed us to move away from statically assigning servers to a region, and to shift capacity between regions based on demand. As a byproduct of this unification project, we had to reconcile and merge the telephone server data that was currently spread across two databases which were hosted in these two regions.\nThe Problem We had two MySQL databases housing telephone server related information in each of our two regions. The goal was to unify the view of data so that it would be the same everywhere. Essentially, the result of running a query on this data should yield the same result regardless of the region it was executed in. We had about 9 tables whose data had to be merged.\nThere were two impediments that faced us:\nPrimary Key(PK) conflicts: PKs were reused across regions, since they were agnostic of each other, which would cause problems if we went for a blind merge. Foreign Key(FK) dependency: This is primarily a side effect on the above. Any change in PKs should take the FK relationships into account so that data consistency is maintained at the end of the operation. The Solution Our databases were slightly asymmetrical such that one region had significantly more data than the other. Adding an offset to the PKs in the smaller DB would ensure that the PKs are continuous and conflict free between the regions. Once the PKs were fixed, we could take a dump and merge the data.\nTo keep the foreign key relationships intact, the changes would have to be propagated to all the tables that referenced these PK columns. The reference relationship can be obtained using the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE table. A simple query like the one detailed in this SO answer would get us all the tables referring to a particular column of a chosen table. When you’re working with multiple tables with multiple relationships, it’s always best to visualize this information to make tracking a little easier. The edges on the graph below denote the column of the referring table which refers to the PK of the referred table.\nWe prepared the list of queries and scripts to be executed beforehand to minimize downtime and to prevent manual errors.

Use prepared statements and canned SQL statements for execution to minimize human error.
