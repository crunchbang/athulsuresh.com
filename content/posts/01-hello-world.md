Hello!

Is there anybody out there?

Nod if you can hear me

This blog is my poor attempt to document all the werid bugs I have encountered in production and the valuable lessons they've taught me.

It took me 5 attempts just to get this page up and running. Hmm. There must be story here that I can stretch to a blog post.
